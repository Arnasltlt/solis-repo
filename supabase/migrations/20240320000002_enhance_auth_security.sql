-- This migration enhances authentication security
-- These settings will need to be applied via the Supabase Dashboard or API
-- because ALTER SYSTEM commands cannot run inside transaction blocks

/*
To apply these settings:

1. Go to the Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
3. Enable the following settings:
   - Secure password recovery (leaked password detection)
   - Email confirmations
   - SMS OTP and TOTP multi-factor authentication
   - Set minimum password length to 12
   - Enable strong password policy
   - Configure session timeout settings

Alternatively, use the Supabase Management API to configure these settings:
https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/auth-config
