# Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing user authentication in the Solis application. Based on the requirements, we need to support three types of users:

1. **Free Users**: Basic access to free content
2. **Premium Users**: Access to all content 
3. **Admin Users**: Full administrative capabilities

The database already has the necessary structure to support these user types through the `access_tiers` table and the `subscription_tier_id` column in the `auth.users` table.

## Current State Assessment

- Supabase authentication is already configured in the project
- The database has appropriate tables and columns for user tiers
- There are access tier migrations in place (free, premium, and administrator)
- A Supabase provider component exists but complete authentication flows are not implemented

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Authentication Components

#### 1.1 Create Authentication Components
- Sign Up Form
- Sign In Form
- Password Reset Form
- Email Verification Component
- Profile Management

#### 1.2 Create Protected Routes
- Implement route protection based on authentication status
- Implement route protection based on user tier

### 2. Authentication Pages

#### 2.1 Create Authentication Pages
- `/login` - Login page
- `/signup` - Sign up page
- `/reset-password` - Password reset page
- `/verify` - Email verification page
- `/profile` - User profile page

### 3. Authentication Hooks and Utilities

#### 3.1 Create Authentication Hooks
- `useAuth` - Hook for authentication state and methods
- `useRole` - Hook for checking user roles/tiers

#### 3.2 Create Authentication Utilities
- Authentication state management
- Role-based access control

### 4. Authentication API Routes

#### 4.1 Create Authentication API Routes
- `/api/auth/signup` - Sign up API
- `/api/auth/signin` - Sign in API
- `/api/auth/signout` - Sign out API
- `/api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset API
- `/api/auth/verify-email` - Email verification API

### 5. User Migration Strategy

#### 5.1 Plan for Migrating Users from Wix
- Export user data from Wix
- Script to import users into Supabase
- Map Wix user roles to Supabase tiers
- Plan for handling passwords (likely will require password resets)

### 6. Role-Based Access Control

#### 6.1 Implement RBAC System
- Create middleware for checking user roles
- Implement UI components that render conditionally based on user role
- Set up RLS policies in Supabase

### 7. Testing

#### 7.1 Test Authentication Flows
- Sign up
- Sign in
- Sign out
- Password reset
- Email verification

#### 7.2 Test Role-Based Access
- Test access for Free users
- Test access for Premium users
- Test access for Admin users

### 8. Deployment

#### 8.1 Deployment Considerations
- Environment variables
- Supabase configuration
- Email provider configuration

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Create authentication components and pages
2. **Week 2**: Implement authentication hooks and utilities
3. **Week 3**: Create API routes and role-based access control
4. **Week 4**: Testing and deployment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up Flow**:
   - User enters email, password, and other required information
   - System creates user in Supabase Auth
   - System assigns default "free" tier to new users
   - System sends verification email
   - User verifies email to access the system

2. **Sign In Flow**:
   - User enters email and password
   - System authenticates user against Supabase Auth
   - System retrieves user tier information
   - System grants appropriate access based on user tier

3. **Password Reset Flow**:
   - User requests password reset
   - System sends password reset email
   - User clicks link in email
   - User sets new password

### User Tier Management

- **Free to Premium Upgrade**:
  - User initiates upgrade process
  - System processes payment
  - System updates user's `subscription_tier_id` to premium
  - System grants premium access

- **Admin User Management**:
  - Admin users are managed manually through the Supabase dashboard or admin panel
  - Admin users can manage content and other users

### Database Schema

The database already has the necessary structure:
- `access_tiers` table with tiers: free, premium, administrator
- `auth.users` table with `subscription_tier_id` column referencing `access_tiers.id`

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to adding authentication with role-based access to the Solis application. The plan leverages Supabase's authentication and database capabilities, ensuring a secure and scalable authentication system.
